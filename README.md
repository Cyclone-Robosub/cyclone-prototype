# Cyclone Thruster Firmware Prototype

## Desc:
Prototype for thruster control and allocation scheme. No CV yet.

## Goal(s):
1. Create an abstraction for each of the thrusters, which allows for seamless interfacing with the simulation and an ability to interface with the
   Rpi4 to allocate thrust to each of the thrusters.
